This is a program I created from scratch by myself. The idea came when I had to make a tic tac toe game at the beginning of my senior year. I wondered what it would be like if I tried to create a bot for the game that learns how to play through playing itself, and being rewarded for winning games. I worked on the project on and off for a year, improving the algorithm and the UI. The idea eventually morphed into a reinforced learning machine that could learn any game, by keeping the game fully detached from the machine itself. I plan to continue improving the algorithm and add more games with time.

**IMMPORTANT
All the settings to adjust the bot are contained in MachineControl.java 
Don't edit any other files if you want the bot to work properly
